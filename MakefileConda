# The following `conda-env-*` targets show basic commands for
# dealing with `conda` environment manager.  For creating the
# necessary Python environment manager, make sure to have `conda`
# installed and run `conda-env-update`, which can be used for both
# creating the environment and updating it in case the definitions
# in `environment.yaml` file are changed.  This file has the <name>
# of the environment to be created.  Run `conda activate <name>` to
# have the Python environment activated and ready to run the code
# of this repository.
